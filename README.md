# Learn Holochain
A guide for self directed study through the [open holochain curriculum](https://github.com/CodeWithJV/open-holochain-curriculum)

## Getting started
Fork this repository to your account and mark your progress with checkboxes as you go.

## Prerequisites
- Basic rust (familiar with Chapters 1 - 11 of the Rust book)
- Basic javascript and web development

You don't need to be an expert in either but if you aren't comfortable with these languages you may want to take some time to focus on them first.

## Module 1 : Holochain fundamentals

This module is an in depth overview of the core concepts and libraries of Holochain. By the end of it you will have a solid understanding of all the code generated for you by the scaffold tool and the ability to build simple Holochain applications.

* [ ] [1.1 Introduction to Holochain](./1-holochain-fundamentals/1-holochain-introduction.md)
* [ ] 1.2 Actions and Entries
* [ ] 1.3 Links and Anchors
* [ ] 1.4 Validation and Testing
